# P5.js Final Project

The repository for my final project for my Creative Coding class while an undergrad at the University of Miami in 2016.

The project creates a physical environment for music that is heard when a character is hovered over, seen [here](https://vimeo.com/243979153).

The animations on screen act as manifestations of the emotions in the music.


## Code

This project was built using the P5 Javascript library.
